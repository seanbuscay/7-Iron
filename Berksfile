# [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) is used in the
# [Chef Development Kit](https://docs.getchef.com/#chef-dk-title) workflow to
# manage cookbook dependencies.  The Berksfile is like Ruby's Bundler `Gemfile`
# or Composer's `composer.json`.  The Berksfile usually contains entries known
# as sources which identify what cookbooks to retrieve.  Our Berksfile simply
# uses our metadata.rb to retrieve the dependencies list before downloading them.
