# The [Kitchen executable](https://docs.getchef.com/ctl_kitchen.html)
# (which is used for running tests against the build) uses a config file to
# define what Kitchen needs to be able to run tests against the build
# "A kitchen.yml file is used to define what is required to run Kitchen,
#   including the driver, the provisioner, and that platforms that are used to
#   create instances on which one (or more) test suites will run. ""
