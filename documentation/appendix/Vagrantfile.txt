# 7-Iron's default web docroot is: /home/vagrant/workspace/docroot
# Webpages in this directory may be reached via your local browser at this URL:
# http://7-Iron.dev or IP - http://192.168.33.33/dev
#
# Scenario One - [DEFAULT] Just serve web pages:
#
#   By default, this Vagrantfile will sync the directory it is in to:
#     /home/vagrant/workspace/docroot
#
#   To use 7-Iron to serve your project's webpages, put this Vagrant
#   file in your project's web root directory.
#
#   - Hint: where index.php or index.html is located.
#
# Scenario Two - Run tests and serve web pages.
#
#   Given your project's web docroot is one level down like this:
#
#     /tests
#     /docroot
#     /docroot/index.php
#     /docroot/robots.txt
#
#   And you put this Vagrantfile at the top level of your project like this:
#
#     /Vagrantfile
#     /tests
#     /docroot
#
#   And you uncomment this line `#sync_target = "/home/vagrant/workspace"` in
#   code below.
#
#   Then, 7-Iron will sync your project directories like this:
#
#     /home/vagrant/workspace/tests
#     /home/vagrant/workspace/docroot/index.php
#     /home/vagrant/workspace/docroot/robots.txt
#
#   And you may run your tests on 7-Iron as well as serve your web pages.
#
#  - Tip: Add .vagrant to your .gitignore file to keep from committing the directory.

# Sets where to put your code on 7-Iron.
sync_target = "/home/vagrant/workspace/docroot"

# Uncomment the line below for the use case in Scenario Two.
#sync_target = "/home/vagrant/workspace"

# Sets where on your local machine to sync from.
# The setting below starts your sync from the directory this Vagrant file is in.
sync_source = "."

# Change these to lower the memory and cpu usage in the vm.
# Values can be anything for memory.  Typical values are:
# 256, 512, 1024.
memory = '1024'
# Typical values are 1 through 4.
